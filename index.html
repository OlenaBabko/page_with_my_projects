                <p>Croissant project is a multiple page hosting project consisting of 3 related responsive pages,
                    and is already SEO friendly. I wanted to personalize the task a little. Therefore,
                    instead of pages about croissants, appeared a page dedicated to its Ukrainian counterpart - 
                    Kiflyky. Here you will find a step-by-step cooking recipe from the famous Ukrainian chef 
                    Yevhen Klopotenko. I chose his recipe because he made a significant contribution to the 
                    popularization of our culture around the world. On the contact page there is a link where 
                    you can find his other recipes of traditional Ukrainian cuisine.

                </a>
                <p>The task of creating a real Weather App was not an easy one! It took a lot of time, 
                    but in return it gave me a lot more knowledge. Weather App contains Search city engine and 
                    Current Location button, which uses the Geolocation API to get your GPS coordinates and 
                    display the city and current temperature using the OpenWeather API. So here are present - 
                    API integration, unit conversion, wind speed, weather description, and weather icons.

                <p> This was my very first landing page from Create a landing page from scratch. The task 
                    was to make basic page with a user interaction, dedicated to something you are passionate about.
                    I am a huge succulent lover and so this was the first thing I thought about at that moment.

                </a>
                <p>it was an attempt to create a new CV for future interviews. As it turned out, it was a stupid idea, 
                    because everywhere HR ask for and save only PDFs in their databases. Therefore, there was no 
                    longer any inspiration to bring the idea to the ideal. But it was also good training for me.
